Exclude creating shim executables for coreutils listed.
You would have to run coreutils <util> to run the util.
Set it to the following to avoid conflicts with CMD and
native Windows utilities with the same names:
exclude-coreutils = [
    # System32
    'expand',
    'hostname',
    'more',
    'whoami',
    'sort',
    'find',
    # CMD
    'rmdir',
    'dir',
    'type',
]

The following utils are usually not used, and often conflicts,
so they are always removed:
- `link.exe` - conflicts with MSVC
